# Public Assets

Use this directory to store any static assets that need to be publicly accessible (logos, images, video clips, etc.).

```
public/
├── logos/    # Brand marks, icons, favicons
├── images/   # Hero art, section illustrations, marketing screenshots
└── videos/   # MP4/WebM clips, animation exports
```

Keep filenames lowercase-with-dashes and include source credits when required. Update the HTML/CSS references to point to these locations whenever you add new assets.
